## Infractions

An ***infraction*** shall hereby be defined as a penalty given as a result of a violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide by any individual who has agreed to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below.

Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:

 * **Level I**: A ***Level I Infraction*** is defined as a formally documented violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project. All Level I infractions will be reset weekly.
 * **Level II**: A ***Level II Infraction*** will be given to an individual who has accumulated three Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction, the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a check for the week. All Level II infractions will be reset weekly.
 * **Level III**: A ***Level III Infraction*** will be given to an individual who has accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction, the individual will be docked 10% of their grade for the current project. All Level III infractions will be reset after the completion of the current project.

If an individual commits multiple violations of the Conduct Guide, a team or project leader may suggest a proportional amount of Level I infractions for the violations to the instructor. While a team or project leader may suggest any number of infractions, an individual should not incur more than **three** infractions for a single instance of violations. The number of Level I infractions imposed upon the individual shall ultimately be determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received from the instructor in regards to being given the infraction(s) will be final.
