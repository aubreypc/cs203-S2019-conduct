## Conduct

In this context, we will be defining conduct as the way a team member behaves
and the way they act when carrying out their part of the project. First, everyone
is obligated to adhere to the 9 categories in the Code of Conduct. They will be
our foundation throughout the semester when working together. Moving on, everyone
should respect one another; no one should be excluded based on their race or gender.
Team members should not shun the ideas of anyone, especially those who may
have not have had an equal amount of experience as others. Also, at the beginning
of each session, everyone should enter with positive attitudes, These positive
attitudes should stay consistent whether the project is working or breaking.

* **Acceptable Conduct (A):**
  * Respect to all peers
  * Allowing all members to voice their opinion
  * Showing positive attitudes towards all aspects of the project
* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
  * Excluding members of team based on their race or gender
  * Refusal to follow the rest of the categories in the Code of Conduct
  * Showing a negative attitude towards group members or aspects of the project

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all Labs on time. If you and
your team deem it possible, team members may leave the lab, so long as they
are available via `Slack` for the allotted lab times. This would be considered
working remotely, and requires the consent of the other team members or
approval from the instructor. For further guidance on attendance in `Labs` and
`Class` please refer to the [course
website](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/), contact the
[instructor](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/contact/), or schedule an
[appointment](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).

## Deadlines

To determine appropriate deadlines conduct policies it is first important to
break up deadlines into the different types of possible deadlines for the
course. The deadlines categories that are possible are those when working
directly with group members to finish work necessary to move onto other parts
of the lab, along with completing your assigned portion of the work by the due
date of the lab.

* **Acceptable Behavior (C)**
  * Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.
  * Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work should be completed
  leaving time for the rest of the lab.
  * Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may
  not align with yours.
  * If you can not come up with an agreed upon time frame, have a vote
  between teammates that are present to determine the time frame.
  * If problems still arise then seek out other team members.
  * Grade yourself based on the grading scale given to determine how well you
  followed the deadlines section.
  * All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas
  the electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository
  before the assigned deadline.
  * Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by
  the students, and within the one week period before the next laboratory session
  begins.
* **Unacceptable Behavior (U)**
  * Not discussing things with team members on due dates.
  * Not completing work on time.
  * Not participating in votes on material.
  * Not communicating reasons for work being late and not on time.

  accepted and no credit will be given (unless specified otherwise). All submitted
  software project assignments must contain high-quality, well documented code.

## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work.
Participation gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and
implement as a group. In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the
sole responsibility of every team member to be involved in the work going on.
The more we put into our efforts, the better will be the outcome. This can be
an amazing opportunity to bond well with the team members and bring positivity
that will bring long-term benefits for the team.

## Decisions

Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.

* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * Making decisions without notifying team members.
  * Question the decision after it is made.
  * Making a decision based on only popular opinion.

## Postmortems

In the postmortems process of the project we will use proper communication and
teamwork in order to solve problems and issues. Going through postmortems will
help us to debug and ensure problems that arise get taken care of smoothly and
surely.

professional manner by communicating any type of issue/ conflict with any of the
team leaders, technical leads, or the CEO directly.

## Infractions

An ***infraction*** shall hereby be defined as a penalty given as a result of a
violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide by any individual who has agreed
to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below. The infractions for
any individual shall be recorded and managed by the instructor.

A *violation* of the Conduct Guide is defined as any behavior that results in receiving
a "U" (Unacceptable) for any of the above outlined (sub)sections.

Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:

* **Level I**: A ***Level I infraction*** is defined as a formally documented
 violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be
 suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project.
 All Level I infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level II**: A ***Level II infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated three Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction,
 the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a check for the week. All
 Level II infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level III**: A ***Level III infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
 the individual will be docked 10% of their grade for the current project. All
 Level III infractions will be reset after the completion of the current project.

If an individual commits multiple violations of the Conduct Guide, a team or
project leader may suggest a proportional amount of Level I infractions for the
violations to the instructor, provided there is proper citation to the Conduct
Guide for the violations. While a team or project leader may suggest any number
of infractions, an individual *should* not incur more than **three** infractions
for a single instance of violations. The number of Level I infractions imposed
upon the individual shall ultimately be determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said
infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received
from the instructor for being given the infraction(s) will be final.
