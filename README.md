This repository contains the Conduct Guide for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
and students will use this Conduct Guide to govern all course interactions.

## The Conduct Guide

As a team, we developed a Conduct Guide to which we all have agreed to adhere.
Our Conduct Guide is based on direct instruction from the instructor, as well as
inspiration taken from sources such as [Codes of Values from MIT's Course on
Product Engineering
Processes](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/codeOfEthics/codeOfEthics.html).
The Conduct Guide is divided into 9 unique sections:

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
* Participation
* Conduct
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
* Infractions

The details for each section can be found in the `conduct.md` document
[here](conduct.md). Every student in this course has agreed to adhere to the
Conduct Guide via digital signature at the end of the `conduct.md` document.

## Problems with the Conduct Guide

If you have any problems with this Conduct Guide, then please create an issue
